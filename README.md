🔐 Password Strength Evaluation – Make Your Passwords Unbreakable!

📌 Overview

In today’s digital world, passwords are the first line of defense 🔰 against hackers.

This project is a hands-on experiment where we:

Create passwords of different complexities 🛠️

Test them on an online password strength checker 🌐

Learn what makes a password strong 💪

Understand how hackers crack weak passwords 🕵️‍♂️

🛠️ Steps Performed

1️⃣ Created Multiple Passwords

From very weak to extremely strong

Mixed uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols 🔤🔢💥

Varied lengths from short (6 chars) to long (16+ chars)

2️⃣ Tested Passwords

Used the Bitwarden Password Strength Checker 💻

Recorded scores & feedback 📊

3️⃣ Documented Results

Captured screenshots 📸

Created an explanation PDF 📄 with visuals and tips

4️⃣ Researched Password Attacks

Brute Force Attack ⚒️ → Guessing every possible combination

Dictionary Attack 📚 → Using a list of common passwords

Credential Stuffing 🗂️ → Using stolen credentials from leaks

📊 Findings & Best Practices

✅ Use at least 12–16 characters

✅ Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

✅ Avoid dictionary words and common patterns 🚫 ("password123")

✅ Never reuse passwords 🔁

✅ Use a password manager 🗝️ to store complex passwords

💡 Pro Tip: The longer & more random your password, the harder it is to crack 🔒
