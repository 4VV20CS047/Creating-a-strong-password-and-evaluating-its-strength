# 🔐 Task 7 Analysis: Password Strength Evaluation

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task was to evaluate the strength of various passwords, understand what makes a password secure, and learn about common password attack methods.

## 🛠️ Steps Taken

1. **📝 Created Multiple Passwords**
   - Designed passwords ranging from very weak ❌ to extremely strong ✅.
   - Mixed uppercase 🔠, lowercase 🔡, numbers 🔢, and special symbols ✨.
   - Varied lengths from short (6 characters) to long (16+ characters).

2. **🧪 Tested Passwords**
   - Used the **Bitwarden Password Strength Checker** 🛡️ to assess strength.
   - Recorded scores 📊 and tool feedback for each password.

3. **📂 Documented Results**
   - Captured screenshots 📸 of password strength results.
   - Compiled a detailed explanation PDF 📑 with visuals and tips.

4. **🔍 Researched Password Attacks**
   - **💣 Brute Force Attack** → Trying every possible character combination.
   - **📚 Dictionary Attack** → Using common words or known password lists.
   - **🕵️ Credential Stuffing** → Using stolen credentials from breaches.

## 📌 Findings & Best Practices
- ✅ Use at least **12–16 characters** for strong security.
- ✅ Include uppercase 🔠, lowercase 🔡, numbers 🔢, and special symbols ✨.
- ✅ Avoid dictionary words 📖, sequences ➡️, or predictable patterns.
- ✅ Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts 🔄.
- ✅ Use a **password manager** 💾 to store and generate complex passwords.

**💡 Pro Tip:**  
The longer and more random a password is, the harder it is for hackers to crack 🛡️.
